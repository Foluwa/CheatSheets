# SQL Cheat Sheet

## Glossary
### SQL
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. It stands for Structured Query Language.

### RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

### Table
A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.

### Semicolon
A semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

### SQL Comments
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

**Single Line Comments(--)**

    --Select all:
    SELECT * FROM Customers;

    SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';


**Multi-line Comments (start with /`*` and end with `*`/)**

    /*SELECT * FROM Customers;
    SELECT * FROM Products;
    SELECT * FROM Orders;
    SELECT * FROM Categories;*/
    SELECT * FROM Suppliers;

### SQL Stored Procedures for SQL Server
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it. You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

**Stored Procedure Syntax**

    CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    AS
    sql_statement
    GO;

**Execute a Stored Procedure**

    EXEC procedure_name;

**Stored Procedure Example**

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure named "SelectAllCustomers" that selects all records from the "Customers" table:

    CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
    AS
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    GO;

**Execute the Stored Procedure**

    EXEC SelectAllCustomers;

**Stored Procedure With One Parameter**

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:

    CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
    AS
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
    GO;

**Execute the Stored Procedure**

    EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';

**Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters**

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:

    CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
    AS
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
    GO;

**Execute the Stored Procedure**

    EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';   

## Data Control Language (DCL) Commands
Command | Description | Example(s) | Illustration(s)
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
GRANT | Used to assign permission to users to access database objects.
REVOKE | Used to deny permission to users to access database objects.

## Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands
Command | Description | Example(s) | Illustration(s)
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
ALTER | Adds, deletes, or modifies columns in a table, or changes the data type of a column in a table.

CREATE | Creates a database, index, view, table, or procedure.<br><br>**Note**: Make sure you have admin privilege before creating any database. Once a database is created, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: `SHOW DATABASES`; | CREATE DATABASE databasename; | CREATE DATABASE testDB;
CREATE TABLE | Creates a new table in the database. | **Create a Single Table**<br>CREATE TABLE table_name (<br>__column1 datatype,<br>__column2 datatype, ....<br>);<br><br>**Create a Table From Another Table**<br>CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS<br>__SELECT column1, column2,...<br>__FROM existing_table_name<br>__WHERE ....; | **Create a Single Table**<br>CREATE TABLE Persons (<br>__PersonID int,<br>__LastName varchar(255),<br>__FirstName varchar(255),<br>);<br><br>**Create a Table From Another Table**<br>CREATE TABLE TestTable AS<br>SELECT customername,<br>contactname<br>FROM customers;

WHERE | Filters a result set to include only records that fulfill a specified condition.<br><br>**Note**: SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes). However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes. | SELECT column1, column2, ...<br>FROM table_name<br>WHERE condition; | SELECT * FROM Customers<br>WHERE Country='Mexico';<br><br>SELECT * FROM Customers<br>WHERE CustomerID=1;<br><br>SELECT * FROM Customers<br>WHERE Date='2014-04-23';
