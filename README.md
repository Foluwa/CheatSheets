## Getting Started
The cheat sheets are all written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using a tabular view style. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`. You can learn more about Markdown in GitHub's Guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can clone the cheat sheet(s) to your local machine or fork cheat sheet(s) to your remote repository. They can be used as guides that can be referenced when the need arises during your programming sessions.
